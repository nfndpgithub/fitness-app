      Rest days are just as important as exercise. In fact, a successful fitness regimen isn’t complete without rest days.

       <p>
        It’s never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in kids by exposing them to fun fitness activities and sports. Doctors say that participating in different activities develops motor skills and muscles and reduces the risk of developing overuse injuries.
       </p>
       <h3>Ages 3 to 5</h3> 
      <p>
        It’s recommended that children ages 3 to 5 be physically active throughout the day. Regular activity can help improve bone health and start patterns to keep them at a healthy weight as they grow.
       <br/>
       Preschoolers can play team sports, like soccer, basketball, or T-ball, as long as your expectations are realistic. Any sport at this age should be about play, not competition. Most 5-year-old children aren’t coordinated enough to hit a pitched ball and don’t have true ball-handling skills on the soccer field or basketball court.
       </p>

       <h3>Ages 6 to 8</h3> 
       <p>
        Children have developed enough by age 6 that it’s possible for them to hit a pitched baseball and pass a soccer ball or basketball. They can also do gymnastics routines and confidently pedal and steer a two-wheeled bike. Now is the time to expose children to diverse athletic and fitness-related activities.
        <br/>
        Different sports stress growth plates differently, and the variety helps ensure healthy overall development. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ages 9 to 11</h3> 
        <p>
          Hand-eye coordination really kicks in at this point. Children are usually able to hit and accurately throw a baseball and make solid contact with a golf or tennis ball. It’s fine to encourage competition, as long as you don’t put all the focus on winning.
         <br/>
         If children are interested in participating in events such as short triathlons or distance running races, these are safe as long as they have trained for the event and maintain healthy hydration. 
         </p>

         <h3>Ages 12 to 14</h3> 
        <p>
          Kids may lose interest in the structured environment of organized sports as they reach adolescence. They may wish to focus instead on strength- or muscle-building exercises. But unless your child has entered puberty, discourage lifting heavy weights.
         <br/>
         Encourage healthier options, such as stretchy tubes and bands, as well as body-weight exercises like squats and pushups. These develop strength without putting bones and joints in danger.
         </p>

         <h3>Age 15 and older</h3> 
         <p>
          Once your teen has gone through puberty and is ready to lift weights, urge them to take a weight-training class or a few sessions with an expert. Poor form can harm muscles and cause fractures.
          <br/>
          If your high schooler expresses interest in endurance events like triathlons or marathons, there’s no reason to say no (although many races have minimum age requirements).
