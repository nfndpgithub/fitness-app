     <p>
      Start every morning with a glass of water with fresh-squeezed lemon or lemon oil! (Just make sure it’s an edible, 100% natural-grade oil and not anything synthetic if you go the essential oil route.) <br/>
     <br/>
      There are so many benefits of lemon water, but the main reasons to drink it are that it flushes your system of toxins, alkalizes your body, and keeps your digestive system working as it should. <br/>
      <br/>
      This gives you more energy, fights off inflammation, and provides you with an all-natural health boost that’s easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

       <p>
        If you struggle with drinking enough water throughout the day, a permanent marker and a clear water bottle might just be the cute but effective health hack you need.<br/>
        <br/>
        Divide the bottle into 200 ml intervals that coordinate with every hour in the day. If you stay on track, you’ll reach the magic eight glasses by dinnertime! Get the complete DIY water bottle how-to here.<br/>
        <br/>
        Better yet, buy a water bottle that already has this done for you!

        <h1 style="color: black"><b>3.Save wilting herbs with an ice cube tray</b></h1>
        <img src="https://gethealthyu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/how-to-save-wilting-herbs-life-hack.jpg.webp" class="center">
         
         <p>
          When your fresh herbs are on the way out (aka starting to turn brown or are wilting), don’t toss them!<br/>
          <br/>
          Instead, put chopped herbs in ice cube trays, fill them with olive oil, and freeze.<br/>
          <br/>
          Now you’ll always have cubes ready for sautéing veggies and meat or tossing in sauces!

            Sore throat? Bust out a bag of marshmallows.<br/>
            <br/>
            Sap from the marshmallow plant has been used for hundreds of years to help treat coughs, colds, and sore throats.<br/>
            <br/>
            The fluffy little guys we know and love from everybody’s favorite campfire treat may help ease throat pain thanks to the coating and soothing properties of the gelatin according to Health magazine.

             <p>
              If you have a tension headache that just won’t go away, try yoga poses that are inversions, meaning they place your head below your heart.<br/>
              <br/>
              Yoga poses for headache relief include downward-facing dog, child’s pose, and legs up the wall pose.<br/>
              <br/>
              These poses will improve circulation, stretch out tense neck and shoulder muscles, and help you relax—all of which can help your headache go away faster.

              <h1 style="color: black"><b>6.Chew gum to curb cravings</b></h1>
              <img src="https://gethealthyu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shutterstock_569994736.jpg.webp" class="center">      
               <p>
                When your cravings aren’t due to hunger, but more out of boredom, try chewing a piece of bubblegum instead of looking through the freezer for some ice cream.<br/>
                <br/>
                It takes your mind off whatever sweet treat you were looking for and provides you with an instant distraction..<br/>
